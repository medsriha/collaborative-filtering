## MovieLens rating dataset
We use the MovieLens dataset for this problem. This dataset is actually quite large (24+ million ratings), but we will instead use their smaller subset of 100k ratings. You will have to go fetch this from their website. 

* You can download the archive containing their latest dataset release from http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip (last updated October 2016). 
* For more details (contents and structure of archive), you can read the README at http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-README.html
* You can find general information from their website description located at http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. 

We will only be looking at the ratings data specifically. However, it is good to note that there is additional data available (i.e. movie data and user made tags for movies) which could be used to improve the ability of the recommendation system.
